## Motive

## Interpretation of Loss Functions
We have analysed the below listed loss functions on datasets provided in the next section. We have trained and tested on the those datasets with the following datasets:<br/>
1. Softmax Cross Entropy - SCE
2. L<sub>1</sub> Loss - Except Loss
3. L<sub>2</sub> Loss - Mean squred error
4. Negative Log Likelihood Loss - NLL
5. Binary Cross Entropy - BCE 
6. Sum of Squares - SoS 

## Datasets Utilized
##### Sample Images of CIFAR-10 Dataset

##### Sample Images of MNIST Dataset

##### Sample Images of ImageNet-200 Dataset

##### Sample Images of Corrupted CIFAR-10 Dataset

##### Sample Images of Colored MNIST Dataset

##### Sample Images of ImageNet-R Dataset

## Models Utilized
We have considered to analyse on loss functions by having residual networks as our model encoder and the cross dataset generalization by both residual networks and visual transformers. We have considered the 18 layered version of ResNet and ViT-custom model.
